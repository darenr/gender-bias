Real-time Javascipt gender bias detector. The research behind this can be found [here](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/static/documents/Gaucher-Friesen-Kay-JPSP-Gendered-Wording-in-Job-ads.pdf)

The words listed hre have come from research into language that reflects the gender 'codeing' as masculine and feminine, 
revealing societal bias about these genders. We associate each gender with those qualities, often at an unconscious level.

This javascript based demo - no data is ever sent to the server, all the processing happens locally in your browser - reveals
words that carry these biases and scores the document in its neutrality.
